An AI-powered nutrition assistant would analyze a user's food diary and dietary restrictions to provide personalized and healthy meal suggestions. The project would meet requirements by using natural language processing (NLP) to interpret user entries and leveraging machine learning to build a recommendation engine based on nutritional data. This would be useful because it empowers people to make informed, healthier food choices by offering guidance tailored to their specific needs and goals, such as managing weight or allergies, without the need for constant human oversight. It would help people with dietary restrictions discover suitable recipes, and provide busy individuals with convenient, healthy options, thereby improving their overall well-being and simplifying meal planning. This project would transform everyday eating from a point of stress into a streamlined, health-conscious, and personalized experience.

The phrase "6, 7" is a piece of internet-viral slang that generally holds no fixed meaning. It originated from a rap song and became linked to a professional basketball player who is 6'7" tall. Students often use it as a nonsensical interjection, sometimes with a distinct hand gesture. The tone is usually playful, a way to signal in-group connection or to provoke a laugh. This widespread repetition is essentially an inside joke and a meme that has migrated from social media into hallways and classrooms. Its persistent use simply affirms, "we're in on the latest trend."

I'd implement a "Tech as Tool" policy focusing on deliberate use, not avoidance. Cell phones would be stored during instructional time, only accessible during passing periods and lunch to minimize distraction. Chromebooks would be unlocked for educational use, which includes teacher-approved AI tools like ChatGPT for brainstorming, drafting, and personalized feedback. Blocking all games is short-sighted; therefore, educational or competitive learning games (like Quizlet Live or math simulations) would be allowed as active learning rewards. This balanced approach prioritizes focus, teaches digital citizenship, and prepares students for a world where AI collaboration is the norm. I believe this policy fosters a more engaged and future-ready learning environment.
