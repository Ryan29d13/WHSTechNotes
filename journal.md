An AI-powered nutrition assistant would analyze a user's food diary and dietary restrictions to provide personalized and healthy meal suggestions. The project would meet requirements by using natural language processing (NLP) to interpret user entries and leveraging machine learning to build a recommendation engine based on nutritional data. This would be useful because it empowers people to make informed, healthier food choices by offering guidance tailored to their specific needs and goals, such as managing weight or allergies, without the need for constant human oversight. It would help people with dietary restrictions discover suitable recipes, and provide busy individuals with convenient, healthy options, thereby improving their overall well-being and simplifying meal planning. This project would transform everyday eating from a point of stress into a streamlined, health-conscious, and personalized experience.

The phrase "6, 7" is a piece of internet-viral slang that generally holds no fixed meaning. It originated from a rap song and became linked to a professional basketball player who is 6'7" tall. Students often use it as a nonsensical interjection, sometimes with a distinct hand gesture. The tone is usually playful, a way to signal in-group connection or to provoke a laugh. This widespread repetition is essentially an inside joke and a meme that has migrated from social media into hallways and classrooms. Its persistent use simply affirms, "we're in on the latest trend."

I'd implement a "Tech as Tool" policy focusing on deliberate use, not avoidance. Cell phones would be stored during instructional time, only accessible during passing periods and lunch to minimize distraction. Chromebooks would be unlocked for educational use, which includes teacher-approved AI tools like ChatGPT for brainstorming, drafting, and personalized feedback. Blocking all games is short-sighted; therefore, educational or competitive learning games (like Quizlet Live or math simulations) would be allowed as active learning rewards. This balanced approach prioritizes focus, teaches digital citizenship, and prepares students for a world where AI collaboration is the norm. I believe this policy fosters a more engaged and future-ready learning environment.

Canva AI understood my idea well and built a clear, structured quiz with multiple-choice questions that matched the topic and skill level I described. The parts that worked well were the organization of the questions, the accuracy of the code examples, and the simple, student-friendly language. One thing that didn’t come out as expected was the lack of visual or interactive elements that could make the quiz more engaging. To improve my prompt next time, I could specify that I want a more colorful or game-like design to make it visually appealing. Being good at prompt engineering is valuable because it helps people communicate clearly with AI tools, making it easier to create high-quality projects efficiently in many careers.

one job that uses drones is amazon. the programers codes the drone to follow simple instructions. the pay raise is 20-28$ USD per hour. official credential that verifies a pilot has the necessary knowledge and skills to operate a drone for commercial purposes. It requires passing a test on topics like regulations, weather, and airspace, and is a legal requirement for anyone making money or conducting business with a drone. Yes I would take this jobe since it pays well and might be easy to learn.

A self-driving car might fail to recognize a stopped school bus because its perception system, despite its sophistication, could misclassify the bus or its stop arm as a stationary object or non-priority obstacle, especially if lighting conditions are poor or the signage is partially obscured. The AI could struggle with edge cases, as the dynamic behavior of a stop-arm extending is a less common scenario than encountering a red light, meaning the training data might not sufficiently cover all real-world variables [1]. The sensors might also have blind spots or the LiDAR/camera fusion might misinterpret the 2D stop sign as harmless background clutter rather than an urgent, mandatory traffic control device [1].
To address this safety concern, a crucial area for improvement would be to enhance the system's ability to consistently recognize the unique visual cues of a stopped school bus, particularly the extending stop arm and flashing lights, under various environmental conditions. This could involve refining the AI's training data to include a wider range of scenarios and angles of a deployed stop arm, as well as developing more robust image processing algorithms to detect these specific features even in challenging lighting or weather. Implementing a dedicated subsystem that is specifically tasked with monitoring for school buses and their stop signals, and which has the highest priority to initiate an immediate stop when detected, would be a critical safety improvement to prevent future violations. This system would need to be designed with redundancy and independent verification to minimize the chance of failure.

Autcraft was created by Stuart Duncan in 2013 as a dedicated Minecraft server to protect autistic children and their families from the bullying and exclusion often found on public platforms. Safe spaces are essential because unmoderated environments can expose neurodivergent players to severe harms, including harassment, social isolation, and sensory overload. To mitigate these risks, Autcraft employs a "whitelist" application process and tracks every in-game action, ensuring a predictable and respectful experience. Developers have a responsibility to design these protective systems—such as clear reporting tools and active moderation—because leaving safety entirely to users can lead to toxic cultures where vulnerable groups are pushed out. If developers ignore these duties, platforms risk becoming breeding grounds for discrimination that can have lasting negative impacts on a player's mental health. Beyond Autcraft, other inclusive initiatives like genU GAMER and various serious games provide structured environments where neurodivergent individuals can build social skills safely. These intentional design choices demonstrate that online kindness is not accidental but is built through proactive oversight.

For MAP/TSI:
The test I took was the MAP, and I feel good about my performance because I took my time. I did well on reading comprehension, but the math section felt challenging. I think test prep would help me next time because it would make me more familiar with the question formats.
For Seniors:
I have taken the ACT, but I have not reached my goal score yet. I think I could improve by practicing timed drills. Test prep would be helpful because it would give me more confidence and better strategies for the harder questions.

In a shared space, people should be mindful of how their physical presence and personal habits influence the group dynamic. Personal hygiene and self-care are vital because they serve as a basic form of non-verbal respect for those around us. When we take care of our personal needs, we ensure that our physical presence does not become a source of discomfort for others. Professional behavior matters because it creates a neutral, predictable environment where everyone feels welcome to participate. Maintaining a clean and professional appearance shows that you value the shared environment as much as your own comfort.
Sensory interruptions, such as loud conversations or strong smells, can significantly hinder a person’s ability to perform deep work. When a workspace is filled with noise or pungent odors, it forces the brain to work harder to filter out distractions. Distracting behaviors, such as constant fidgeting or intrusive music, can make it nearly impossible for peers to maintain their focus. It is important to remember that what feels like a minor habit to one person may be a major obstacle for another. By being aware of these factors, we help maintain a high standard of productivity for the entire team.
Reasonable expectations for professional behavior include maintaining a moderate volume, using respectful language, and honoring personal space. Being aware of your surroundings allows you to adjust your behavior before it becomes an issue for someone else. Emotional self-control is another hallmark of professionalism, as it prevents personal frustrations from impacting the work of others. Self-regulation is a critical skill for school and future workplaces because it demonstrates maturity and reliability. When you can control your reactions and impulses, you build a reputation as a composed and dependable colleague.
One habit I can work on is becoming more observant of my non-verbal cues and physical movements in a quiet room. I sometimes forget that small actions, like tapping my foot or clicking a pen, can be highly distracting to people sitting nearby. I plan to practice better self-awareness by checking in with my environment more frequently throughout the day. Improving this habit will help me contribute to a more harmonious and focused atmosphere. By making these small adjustments, I can show my peers that I am committed to being a thoughtful and professional member of the community.

I believe the most important technology used in the 2026 Winter Olympics was high-speed motion tracking. This technology had the biggest impact on fairness because it gave judges a way to see exactly what happened in a race or a jump without having to guess.
This technology was used when athletes competed in figure skating. Tiny sensors were sometimes placed on the skates, and high-speed cameras watched every move. For example, when a skater performed a "Quadruple Jump" (four spins in the air), the computer could instantly count the rotations and measure how high the athlete jumped. It was also used in Short Track Speed Skating to see exactly whose skate crossed the finish line first during a photo finish. This affected the competition because it made the results more accurate. In the past, a judge might make a mistake because the athletes move so fast. Now, the technology provides "proof" so the right person wins the gold medal. However, a concern is that this tech is very expensive. If only the rich countries can afford to practice with these sensors, it might be unfair to athletes from smaller, poorer countries. I think there should be limits on technology. The Olympics should be about which human is the fastest or strongest, not which country has the best computer scientists. If we let technology do all the work, it becomes a contest between machines instead of a contest between people. We should use tech to keep things fair, but we shouldn't let it "play the game" for the athletes.
